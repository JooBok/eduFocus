            - This routine can save images containing any type of pixel.  However,
              save_jxl() can only natively store rgb_pixel, rgb_alpha_pixel and unsigned
              char pixel types.  All other pixel types will be converted into one of
              these types as appropriate before being saved to disk.
            - The quality value determines how lossy the compression is.  Larger quality
              values result in larger output images but the images will look better.
              Although it can range from 0 to 100, the recommended range is between
              68 and 96.  A value of 90 means visually lossless, while a value of 100
              means mathematically lossless.

                This exception is thrown if there is an error that prevents us from saving
                the image.
